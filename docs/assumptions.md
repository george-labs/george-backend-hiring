## Iteration 3

1. I have kept the mytext.txt under project file structure.
2. Made changes in JavaApplication file itself, to get text from either file or user input.
3. Written the test in TextFileWordsLoaderTest to validate readFromFile functionality.

## Iteration 2

1. I have kept the stopwords.txt under resources.
2. Have loaded the stop words from txt file into Set.
