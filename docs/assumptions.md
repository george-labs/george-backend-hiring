# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
## Iteration 2
I am assuming that whenever a user wants to get a wordCount with a file that consists of forbidden words, and the file does not exist then the program stops working.
## Iteration 3
If there is an argument passed as a filename, and the file does not exist, then the program stops working.
## Iteration 4
I assumed that we are checking the uniqueness of the already filtered string (that does not contain the forbidden words)
## Iteration 5
## Iteration 6
I am assuming that we are counting the average length of valid words, not unique ones.
