# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
The assumption is that the word is separated by spaces not by any other character.

## Iteration 2
Stopword is misleading, I would rather use WordsNotToCount or anything more self explanatory.

## Iteration 3
I assume if the program receives an incorrect filename it exists with exception.

## Iteration 4
I think Humpty-Dumpty is one word, it is a phrase.
Stopwords have no impact on how many unique words I have.
The "Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall." sentence contains 10 words, not 9.

## Iteration 5
I assume strings with only dashes count as strings.
