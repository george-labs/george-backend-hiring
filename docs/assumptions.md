# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 4

In iteration 1 was not stated that we are dealing with real sentences. So I assumed that if word ends with dot,
it is not considered as word. The same if word contains: "-".
I modified application in the way that if word contains "-", it is considered as single word and if word ends with ".",
it is considered as valid word.
