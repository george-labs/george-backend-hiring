# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1

## Iteration 2
- The stopwords.txt file is in the current working directory

## Iteration 3
- This is an I/O functionality that is best covered by not a unit test but rather an integration test that runs the whole application as black box
- We can create the integration test application in a separate folder called integration-tests
- Creating a separate application is out of the scope of this exercise and will be skipped
