# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
Based on "Words are stretches of letters (a-z,A-Z)", I assume that words containing numbers are actually not words.

examples: 

"Mary Had 5 lambs"  -> 5 is not a word

"M4ry had" -> M4ry is not a word.


## Iteration 2 

I assume the file stopwords.txt is something already defined in the application, not passed from outside.
