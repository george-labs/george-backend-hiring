# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1

Is the separator for the words white space?

## Iteration 2
Is the stopwords.txt file needed to be present?
Are the stop words from txt file case-sensitive?

## Iteration 3
Should this user file be in the resources directory?
What should I use a delimiter for lines in the file when create a String with full sentence?
If the filename provided by user is not correct should the application asks for a text?
If we have just a white space, blank fileName or empty fileName should the application ask for a text or thrown the exception?
