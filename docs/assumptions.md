# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
- the words are separated by N spaces,  where N > 0

## Iteration 2
- if the file does not exists or other error occured during reading the file, then our program will work without the stopped Words

## Iteration 3
- the words will be case in sensitive, so for example the "am" and the "AM" will represent the same word
- the program will read by default stoppedWord file from the resources, so user will not put the path for that file manually
- the fileName for reading the words by default will be placed under the resources

## Iteration 4
- words is valid only if contains only letters
