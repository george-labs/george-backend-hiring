# Assumptions per iteration


## Iteration 2

1. I have kept the stopwords.txt under resources.
2. Have loaded the stop words from txt file into Set.
3. Able to get number of words count for each sentence provided by user and not considering the stop words given in stopwords.txt file.
4. For this iteration too, I am considering more into having each word as alphabetical not with numeric, punctuations, and more.
5. Have refactored the test file and renamed it.
