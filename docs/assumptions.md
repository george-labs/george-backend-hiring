# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
* I will count the words that only consists of letters that are from alphabet and if there will be any number or any other character except the punctuation I will remove the word from final sum
* Also, I assume that null or blank string input will be consists of zero words

# Iteration 2
* I assume that a words (lines) in file are only lower case
* I assume the we don't provide the file path in program args and it is just a hardcoded path
