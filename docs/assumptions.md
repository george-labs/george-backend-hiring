# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 2
- Stopwords are case sensitive. This means that "The" and "the" are considered different words.

## Iteration 3
- It was not specified where the file should be, so I just put it in the classpath.

## Iteration 4
- Words ending with a special character are counted as unique words. So "Hello" and "Hello!" are considered different words.

## Iteration 5
- It is not clear if the average word length is calculated from the unique or total words. Thats why i chose to calculate it from the unique words.
