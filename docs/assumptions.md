~~# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 2

- I assume that the stop words should be treated as case-insensitive, but the actual stopwords.txt file should only contain lowercase words

## Iteration 4

- I assume that we will have the unique assumption in a case-insensitive way so for input `House HoUse HOUSE house second SECOND` we would count 2 unique
  words
- Because of the example input and output given by the task I assume that from now on I need to support words being separated with
  the following special characters as well: `.` and `-`

## Iteration 6

- I assume that the average word length should be 0 if we have 0 words
