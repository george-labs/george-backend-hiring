# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
I assumed that word cannot contain any other character than [a-zA-Z].  
If as argument is passed null I assumed that method should return 0.

## Iteration 2
I assumed that stopwords.txt only contains words and new line characters.  
If IO operation on file stopwords.txt fail only exception message will be written to console and method return zero stopwords.

## Iteration 4
From iteration4 I assume that hyphen can be taken as white space (word separator) and that word can ends with dot.
