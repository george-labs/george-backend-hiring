# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
I assumed that word cannot contain any other character than [a-zA-Z]. 
If as argument is passed null I assumed that method should return 0.

## Iteration 2
I assumed that stopwords.txt only contains words and new line characters.
If IO operation on file stopwords.txt fail only exception message will be written to console and method return zero stopwords.
