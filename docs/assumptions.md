# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 3
Stop words should probably be case-insensitive.
When sentence ends with dot/exclamation mark etc. it should still count as a word.

## Iteration 4
Unique words are not case-sensitive.

## Iteration 5
Requirements change - words separated other than hyphen are considered as 2 words.

## Iteration 6
Round of average length mathematically to 2 decimal points.
