# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1

## Iteration 2
In the second iteration, we assume that the given stopwords are lowercase and since
we use a Set, also lower and uppercase characters are mentioning different scenarios,
we took every character as lowercase.(case insensitive)


## Iteration 7
I am assuming that the ones that should be printed will be not the unique bot the filtered words after chopping
off stop words and matching them with the regular expression.
