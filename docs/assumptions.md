# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1

### Assume 1
I start with using only alphabetical characters to delimiter a word. Everything else should be ignored.

### Assume 2
If the file that is provided by command line arguments does not exist, error is returned instead of count 0.
Error is message of exception thrown.
