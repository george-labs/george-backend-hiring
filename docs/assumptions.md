# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
- I accept only words that consist of letters (a-z,A-Z). I assume that words are split on blank. Invalid words are filtered out. Other punctuation marks are ignored.

## Iteration 2
- I assume that the stop words are split on line break. I assume that the stop words file is named "stopwords.txt" and is located in the project folder.
- I assume that stop words are case sensitive.
- If the stop words file is not found, I assume that no stop words are used.

## Iteration 3
- I assume that the word list file is located in the project folder.
