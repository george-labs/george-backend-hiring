# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
The assumption is that the word is separated by spaces not by any other character.

## Iteration 2
Stopword is misleading, I would rather use WordsNotToCount or anything more self explanatory.

## Iteration 3
I assume if the program receives an incorrect filename it exists with exception.
