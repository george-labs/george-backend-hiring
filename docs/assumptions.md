# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
- words are stretches of letters (a-z,A-Z)
- stretch of ONLY letters is a word
- something that has for example a number in it is not a word
- there is no specification about how the whole string should be split
- that means if "Hello, World!" is same as a "Hello World"
- so let's assume there will be no special characters in the text
- and we split just by spaces
