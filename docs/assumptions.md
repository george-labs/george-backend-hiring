# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1

## Iteration 2

Assumed that exclusion of words: the, a, on, off is only for lowercase as nothing else is mentioned therefore test:
The An On Off -> Expected 4

# Iteration 3

# Iteration 4

Again assume that comparision is not case sensitive and 'Mary' and 'mary' are treated as two uniques words.
test example: Arguments.of("Mary mary MARY", 3, 3)
