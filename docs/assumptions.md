# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1

* words are separated by the space and does not contain anything else besides a-z,A-Z
* for instance `Hell0 world test` contains just two words - _world_ and _test_
* a newline is considered sa valid separator char, the algorithm should count words in multiline strings properly

## Iteration 2

* stop words are case-sensitive
* a file with stop words passed as a first argument to the program

## Iteration 5

* hyphen only are not words
