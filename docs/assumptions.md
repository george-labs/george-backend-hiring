### Assume 1
I start with using only alphabetical characters to delimiter a word. Everything else should be ignored.

### Assume 2
If the file that is provided by command line arguments does not exist, error is returned instead of count 0.
Error is message of exception thrown.

### Assume 3
Number of average length of word is formatted to show 2 decimal places everytime.

### Assumption 4
I could not find file sometext.txt in a repository, so I created it by myself.
