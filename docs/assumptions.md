# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
# I  assume that when user enter a  word  with  mix of  letters and  other characters we ignore  that  word
#  for  example this  input "I have222 two apples" returns 3

## Iteration 2
#  I assume that the stop words are case sensetive
#  for  example this  input "The  sun is beautiful" returns 4 but  "the  sun is beautiful" returns  3
# I assume that  file name is stopwords.txt and i hard coded it
