# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1
- Robin suggests that words are separated by spaces.
- I also suggest to count in whitespace characters such as tabs etc. (defined by regexp \s)
- To start with we expect "sensible" (less than 100MB) inputs, therefore output will fit in Integer.
- From beginning we expect user input on single line.
