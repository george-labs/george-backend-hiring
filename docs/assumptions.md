# Assumptions per iteration

## Iteration 1-3

1. My assumption is AA55BB is 2 words AA, BB, also AA%$BB is 2 words

## Iteration 4 (assumption from iteration 2+)
2. Assumption that word are considered equal regardless of case sensitivity

3. Changed assumption #1, now words are considered to be A-Za-z sequencies delimited by whitespace, hyphens and dots. So AA2 is not considered to be valid word.
