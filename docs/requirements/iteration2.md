# Word Count II

Not all words are relevant for counting. A list of stop words (provided in the file „stopwords.txt“) 
defines which words not to count. Example of stopwords.txt with each line containing a stop word:

```text
the
a
on
off
```

Example usage:

```shell
$ wordcount
Enter text: Mary had a little lamb
Number of words: 4
$
```
