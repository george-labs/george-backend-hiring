# Word Count I

Write an application to count the number of words in a text. The app will ask the user for the text upon start. It will 
then output the number of words found in the text. Words are stretches of letters (a-z,A-Z). Sample usage:

```shell
$ wordcount
Enter text: Mary had a little lamb
Number of words: 5
$
```
