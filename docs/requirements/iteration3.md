# Word Count III

The application can be started with a filename to read the text from instead of entering it manually. 
If no filename is provided, the application will still ask for a text. Sample usage:

```shell
$ wordcount mytext.txt
Number of words: 4
$
```

With `mytext.txt` being:

```text
Mary had
a little
lamb
```
